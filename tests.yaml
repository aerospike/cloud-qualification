Tests:
    # values are comma delimited in the following order: start, end, interval.
    # so with service-threads: 2,8,2, the test will start at 2, then 4, 6, and end at 8.
#    service-threads: 2,8,2
#    transaction-queues: 2,8,2
#    transaction-threads-per-queue: 2,8,2
#    max-write-cache:     not a performance item
#    fabric-workers: 16,8,32
#    post-write-queue: 128,1024,128
#    allow-inline-transactions: true
    # write-block-size, units are in kilobytes, interval is a multiplier
    # so 128,1024,2 is: 128,256,512,1024
#    write-block-size: 128,1024,2
    write-block-size: 1024,1024,2
